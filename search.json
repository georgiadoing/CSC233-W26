    "text": "Course Description\nData analytics, the process of analyzing, revealing, interpreting and visualizing information concealed inside big data is revolutionizing daily life, as used by companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, for the diagnosis of medical conditions or the way medical claims are handled, for investment strategies and real estate pricing, and in academia, with the analysis of historical texts, understanding the deliberations of the Supreme Court or the European Commission, or processing large amounts of genomics data.\nIn this class, students will be introduced to techniques to acquire data from the web, manipulate and pre-process data into manageable forms, perform analyses from a descriptive and predictive standpoint, and learn the basics of visualization of the result, all with a focus on storytelling through data, enhancing data literacy.\nIn this course you will use the Python programming language to scrape web data, prepare data for analysis, analyze to produce explainable results, and visualize those results. Throughout we will discuss the pitfalls, ethics and challenges of working with data. A 1-page schedule-at-a-glance is included at the end of the syllabus.\nThis course requires the pre-approval of the department. For more information, please visit: https://union.edu/advising-registration/pre-approval.",

That means choosing data (or sets of data) that are NOT already pre-processed, and perfectly packaged. I need to see some (but not all) of merging, joining, creating new columns, selecting columns, changing types of data.\nI need to see visualizations. Don’t just graph everything because you can. Show me things that assist with your story.\nI would like some specific analytics - discussion in combination with analytic approaches - i.e. what features are important for a specific problem, what trends exist in the data and how do you explain them? I’m not looking for you to be right, I’m looking for your story to be well-motivated by data\nNotice I keep saying ‘story’. To tell a story with data REQUIRES that you have a good understanding of the data. To that end I encourage you to choose data, or focus on a problem, about which you ALREADY have some knowledge, or intuition\nYou can find data in all kinds of places on the web. I would focus on CSV data (but you do not have to). You can find useful repositories at data.gov, and kaggle.com, among MANY others. Be cautious about kaggle. I will check to see if others have already performed exactly the analysis you attempt. You certainly don’t have to be completely novel, but I would stay away from extremely popular, heavily used data.\nIt is impossible to give minimum or maximum requirements on data size. However, too little data ( less than 500 instances) leaves little chance for finding useful patterns. Too few attributes (columns, less than 5) means that you either need to merge in complementary data, or create your own additional columns. Conversely too much data (in rows or columns) means that you almost certainly have to START reducing the size of your data.\nI cannot tell you how long your notebook should be. HOWEVER consider the size of the grade which this notebook is worth. It should be CONSIDERABLY more in depth than a weekly assignment.\nI am looking to learn. Part of your grade will be in how well YOU take ME on a journey through data which honestly, at the end, you should understand significantly better than I do. Telling that story is a combination of code (show me results, do not comment out the good stuff) and the write up. This IS part essay, part presentation, part coding exercise.",
