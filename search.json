Throughout we will discuss the pitfalls, ethics and challenges of working with data. A 1-page schedule-at-a-glance is included at the end of the syllabus.\nThis course requires the pre-approval of the department. For more information, please visit: https://union.edu/advising-registration/pre-approval.",

    "text": "your analytic skills (using Python to get, manipulate, analyze and visualize)\nyour story telling skills (how do you use the above, to tell a coherent story using data)\n\n\n\n\nI need to see you use Pandas to do things. That means choosing data (or sets of data) that are NOT already pre-processed, and perfectly packaged. I need to see some (but not all) of merging, joining, creating new columns, selecting columns, changing types of data.\nI need to see visualizations. Don’t just graph everything because you can. Show me things that assist with your story.\nI would like some specific analytics - discussion in combination with analytic approaches - i.e. what features are important for a specific problem, what trends exist in the data and how do you explain them? I’m not looking for you to be right, I’m looking for your story to be well-motivated by data\nNotice I keep saying ‘story’. To tell a story with data REQUIRES that you have a good understanding of the data. To that end I encourage you to choose data, or focus on a problem, about which you ALREADY have some knowledge, or intuition\nYou can find data in all kinds of places on the web. I would focus on CSV data (but you do not have to). You can find useful repositories at data.gov, and kaggle.com, among MANY others. Be cautious about kaggle. I will check to see if others have already performed exactly the analysis you attempt. You certainly don’t have to be completely novel, but I would stay away from extremely popular, heavily used data.\nIt is impossible to give minimum or maximum requirements on data size. However, too little data ( less than 500 instances) leaves little chance for finding useful patterns. Too few attributes (columns, less than 5) means that you either need to merge in complementary data, or create your own additional columns. Conversely too much data (in rows or columns) means that you almost certainly have to START reducing the size of your data.\nI cannot tell you how long your notebook should be. HOWEVER consider the size of the grade which this notebook is worth. It should be CONSIDERABLY more in depth than a weekly assignment.\nI am looking to learn. Part of your grade will be in how well YOU take ME on a journey through data which honestly, at the end, you should understand significantly better than I do. Telling that story is a combination of code (show me results, do not comment out the good stuff) and the write up. This IS part essay, part presentation, part coding exercise.",
